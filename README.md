🚖 Spring Boot Uber App

A backend clone of Uber implemented using Java Spring Boot.
This project demonstrates a real-world ride-hailing application backend with features like user onboarding, driver management, ride booking, fare calculation, ride completion, and rating system.

📝 Overview

This project is a backend-only implementation of Uber-like services.
It handles the complete lifecycle of a ride:

User requests a ride

System assigns a driver

Fare is calculated based on distance

Ride is completed and payment processed

Ratings collected from both sides

It is designed to simulate production-grade APIs that can be integrated with a mobile frontend (Android/iOS) or web UI.
